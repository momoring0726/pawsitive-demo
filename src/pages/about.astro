          Our Story
        </h1>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Pawsitive Start Rescue</strong> was founded in 2024 by a small
          group of friends who were heartbroken by the overcrowding in our local
          city shelters. We saw so many wonderful, loving animals who were at
          risk simply because there wasn't enough space.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
          We decided to do something about it. We are an all-volunteer,
          non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing dogs and cats and
          placing them in loving foster homes until their permanent, forever
          families can be found.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Our mission is simple: to give animals in need a second chance at a
          happy life. We believe every animal deserves love, care, and a safe
          place to call home.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
          We provide all necessary veterinary care,
          including spaying/neutering and vaccinations, for every animal that
          comes into our rescue.
